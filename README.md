> [!NOTE]
> This simulator is part of a major project focused on different scheduling algorithms for Operating Systems studies.
> It is available at the "Scheduling Playground" repository: [click here](https://github.com/Rayllac/Scheduling-Playground).
> It is coordinated by PhD Prof. Thiago Emmanuel Pereira, from the Computer Science course at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG).
